# Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles, which include configurations for various applications and tools. These dotfiles are designed to enhance my development workflow and personalize my working environment.

Feel free to explore and use any parts of these dotfiles that are relevant to your needs.

I am no longer using yabai and skhd, currently using [karabiner-elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/).
Check my karabiner config [here](https://github.com/wkwhwh/karabiner-config).
